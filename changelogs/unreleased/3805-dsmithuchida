Added BackupPhaseUploading and BackupPhaseUploadingPartialFailure backup phases as part of Upload Progress Monitoring

Uploading (new)
The "Uploading" phase signifies that the main part of the backup, including 
snapshotting has completed successfully and uploading is continuing. In 
the event of an error during uploading, the phase will change to 
UploadingPartialFailure. On success, the phase changes to Completed. The 
backup cannot be restored from when it is in the Uploading state.

UploadingPartialFailure (new)
The "UploadingPartialFailure" phase signifies that the main part of the backup,
including snapshotting has completed, but there were partial failures either 
during the main part or during the uploading. The backup cannot be restored 
from when it is in the UploadingPartialFailure state.
